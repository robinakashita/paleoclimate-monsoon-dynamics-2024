# monsoon-dynamics-2024
This project analyzes TraCE and iTraCE climate models and compares them with speleothem records from Madagascar to study past monsoon variability in the Southern Indian Ocean. Using Python, I processed spatial climate data to evaluate seasonal annual mean precipitation patterns during key deglacial periods.
