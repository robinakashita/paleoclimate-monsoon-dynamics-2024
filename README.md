# Understanding Monsoon Dynamics in East Africa (Madagascar) and the Southern Indian Ocean (MIT MSRP 2024)

This repository contains the full analysis pipeline developed during the MIT Summer Research Program (MSRP 2024) in the McGee Lab (MIT EAPS). The goal of this project is to compare paleoclimate proxy records from Madagascar with TraCE-21ka and iTraCE-21ka climate model simulations to better understand long-term monsoon variability in the Southern Indian Ocean.

All work is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebooks:

- TraCE_vs_Observations.ipynb

- Comp_Diff_TraCE.ipynb

- Comp_Diff_iTraCE.ipynb

- LGM_TimeSeries_vs_TraCE.ipynb

- iTrace_vs_AB-12.ipynb
